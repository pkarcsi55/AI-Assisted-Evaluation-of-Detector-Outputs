Project Overview
This project demonstrates how simple, low-cost LED-based detectors combined with an ESP32 microcontroller can be used for real-time signal classification using artificial
intelligence. By converting spectral information into voltage signals, the system enables fast and accurate analysis of light properties such as color and intensity.
The integrated machine learning model processes the data and provides immediate feedback, making the setup ideal for educational environments.
Students can explore physical phenomena and gain hands-on experience with modern AI-driven data evaluation techniques.
